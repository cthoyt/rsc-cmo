title: Chemical Methods Ontology
description: "CHMO, the chemical methods ontology, describes methods used to collect data in chemical experiments, such as mass spectrometry and electron microscopy prepare and separate material for further analysis, such as sample ionisation, chromatography, and electrophoresis synthesise materials, such as epitaxy and continuous vapour deposition It also describes the instruments used in these experiments, such as mass spectrometers and chromatography columns. It is intended to be complementary to the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI)."

        # As yet, there is no reasoned base release (see: https://github.com/obi-ontology/obi/issues/1815). We currently 
        # refrain from using 'make_base: true' as it would cause alot of indirect dependencies 
        # (e.g. CL, GO, ... classes) be dangling on the root level under owl:Thing, and we'd also lose OBIs alignment
        # decisions, such as CL:cell or CHEBI:'molecular entity' being subsumed under BFO:'material entity'. 
        # So since CHMO is an extension of OBI we build the import module like this.
